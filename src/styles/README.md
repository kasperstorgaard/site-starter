# STYLES
This is the home for all the global styles and concepts

## What goes here?
Whenever a concept is highly reusable, this is the place to put it.
(Even if the inital use is limited to very few places)

## Notes
- If a concept is tightly coupled to a component, it should probably live in that component.
- Remember to update the main import, so it becomes globally available.
